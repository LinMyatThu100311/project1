    >There was a merchant called Luis and he travelled from place to place selling different things such as cloth, goods and many more.
    He was smart but also greedy. His things were very expensive and the villagers from different places did not know they were
    expensive because the things that Luis sold were not from their neighbourhood.
     One day he arrived at the village that the king
    Robert owned. The king Robert was a generous man who gave his gold to his people at the village. He gave lots of gold every
    month. Luis arrived at the village by his carriage that he usually sold. As usual, his goods and cloth were overpriced and he managed
    to sell them.</p>

    <p style="font-size: large; border: 3px solid blueviolet; color: hsl(200, 100%, 50%);"
    >A week later, he saw many people heading towards the castle. He didn't know why were many people heading towards there so he
        a man and the man said "They were going towards the castle because the king will give the gold to them. You can only receive the
        gold only once or the king will put you in the dungeon". Luis finally knew why and he wanted the gold too and went to the castle.
        He saw the castle guards giving pieces of gold to other people. There were a lot of people so he had to wait for a bit.
        After he had waited for a bit, he got the gold. But he wanted more gold so a month later he went to there again but the guards
        didn't notice he had received the gold so they gave him again but when he went there for the third time, he got caught.
        He went to there as usual and he waited for a bit for his turn but when it was his turn, one of the guard noticed his face
        and told the other guards to catch him. Luis got dragged to the dungeon and got hung upside down from a ring in the ceiling.

    >There was no food and comfortable place for Luis and he got pretty mad. He wished that he could go back and followed the
        rules. Two days later, the guards told Luis that the king will come to him after he had breakfast. He waited for around 30
        minutes. Then the king came and he asked "Why are you in this dungeon?" and Luis answered "I took the pieces of gold for many tim
        es." and he forgot to say politely to the king but the king is very kind and generous so he gave opportunity to all the prisoners
        except for people that did serious crimes. The king said "I did not release every person in the dungeon but I have heard that
        are a merchant from place that is far away from this land so I will release you since you are a visitor". Luis said "Thank you,
        my king" and he remembered his manners this time. He went back to the village and he decided that  he will follow the rules and
        he decided that he will not be very greedy too.
